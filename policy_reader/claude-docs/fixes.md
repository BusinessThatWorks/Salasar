# Policy OCR Integration - Fixes & Issues

This document tracks issues encountered during implementation and testing, along with their solutions.

## Issue #1: Missing Dependencies for Policy-OCR Library

**Date:** 2025-08-01  
**Status:** üü¢ Resolved  
**Priority:** High  

### Problem
Processing failed when clicking "Process Now" button. The policy-ocr library dependencies (paddle and other OCR dependencies) are not installed in the Frappe virtual environment.

### Error Details
- Processing status changes to "Failed"
- Specific error: "Processing failed: No module named 'paddle'"
- The policy-ocr library is trying to import 'paddle' but the module is named 'paddlepaddle'

### Root Cause
**Investigation findings:**
- Policy-ocr library imports work fine in standalone Python
- All dependencies (paddlepaddle, paddleocr, etc.) are installed correctly
- The error "No module named 'paddle'" occurs only when called from within Frappe context
- This suggests an environment or import path issue within the Frappe worker process

### Solution Options

#### Option 1: Debug Import Path in Frappe Context
```python
# Add debugging to the process_policy method to check import paths
import sys
print("Python path:", sys.path)
print("Paddle available:", 'paddle' in sys.modules)
try:
    import paddle
    print("Paddle import successful")
except ImportError as e:
    print("Paddle import failed:", e)
```

#### Option 2: Force Import Dependencies at Module Level
```python
# At the top of policy_document.py, try importing paddle explicitly
try:
    import paddle
    import paddleocr  
    from policy_ocr import PolicyProcessor, OCRConfig
    print("All imports successful")
except ImportError as e:
    import frappe
    frappe.log_error(f"Import error: {e}", "Policy OCR Import Error")
```

#### Option 3: Environment Variable Check
```bash
# Verify virtual environment is being used by Frappe workers
which python3
pip list | grep -E "(paddle|policy)"
```

### Next Steps
1. Identify exact missing dependencies from error logs
2. Install required packages in Frappe virtual environment
3. Test processing again
4. Document successful installation process

### Impact
- Blocks core functionality of policy processing
- Prevents testing of extracted field display
- User sees failed processing status

## Issue #2: Field Display Persistence Bug + Individual Field Storage

**Date:** 2025-08-01  
**Status:** üü¢ Resolved  
**Priority:** High  

### Problem
1. **Field Display Bug**: When creating a new Policy Document, it shows extracted fields from a previously viewed document even though the current document has never been processed (Status: Draft, Processing Time: 0)
2. **Storage Enhancement Request**: Store extracted fields as individual DocType fields instead of only JSON for better reporting and data management

### Error Details
- New Policy Document (Document #5) shows extracted fields from previous processing
- Fields display when Status = "Draft" and extracted_fields is empty/null
- JavaScript display logic doesn't properly clear stale field displays
- No individual field storage for reporting/filtering

### Root Cause
**JavaScript Caching Issue:**
- `display_extracted_fields()` function only removes existing display when showing new fields
- No cleanup logic when loading documents that shouldn't show fields
- Missing condition to clear display when `status !== 'Completed'` or `extracted_fields` is empty

**Architecture Limitation:**
- All extracted data stored as JSON blob in single field
- No individual fields for direct database queries or reporting

### Solution Plan
#### Phase 1: Fix JavaScript Bug
1. Add field clearing logic in `refresh` event for non-completed documents
2. Improve condition checking to prevent stale data display
3. Add proper cleanup when switching between documents

#### Phase 2: Add Individual Field Storage
1. Add 17 individual fields for Motor policies (Policy Number, Chassis Number, etc.)
2. Add 11 individual fields for Health policies (Policy Number, Customer Code, etc.)
3. Configure conditional display based on policy_type
4. Maintain existing JSON field for backward compatibility

#### Phase 3: Update Controllers
1. **Python**: Map extracted JSON data to individual fields after processing
2. **JavaScript**: Show/hide relevant field sections based on policy type
3. **Database**: Run migrations to add new fields

### ‚úÖ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

#### Phase 1: JavaScript Bug Fix
- Added `clear_extracted_fields_display()` function to remove stale displays
- Modified `refresh` event to clear displays before showing new content
- Improved condition checking to only show fields when status = "Completed" AND fields exist

#### Phase 2: Individual Field Storage
- **Added 28 individual fields**: 15 Motor + 11 Health + 2 section breaks
- **Conditional display**: Fields show/hide based on policy_type selection
- **Database structure**: Each extracted field stored individually for reporting
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintained existing JSON field

#### Phase 3: Controller Updates
- **Python**: Added `populate_individual_fields()` and `clear_individual_fields()` methods
- **Field mapping**: Automatic mapping from JSON extraction to individual fields
- **Processing lifecycle**: Clear fields on start, populate on success, clear on failure
- **JavaScript**: Enhanced display logic prevents stale data persistence

### Resolution Impact
- ‚úÖ **Bug Fixed**: No more stale field displays on new documents
- ‚úÖ **Individual Storage**: Each field stored separately for reporting/filtering
- ‚úÖ **Conditional UI**: Relevant fields shown based on policy type
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Data Structure**: Better database design for queries and analytics

## Issue #3: Manual Field Entry + Background Processing

**Date:** 2025-08-01  
**Status:** üü¢ Resolved  
**Priority:** High  

### Problem
1. **Read-Only Fields**: All individual fields are read-only, preventing manual data entry when OCR fails to extract values
2. **Synchronous Processing**: Policy processing blocks the UI, creating poor user experience for large files

### Error Details
- Individual fields set to `read_only: 1` cannot be edited by users
- When OCR misses a field, users cannot manually enter the missing data
- PDF processing runs synchronously, blocking form interaction
- No progress indicators during processing
- No background job management

### Root Cause
**Field Configuration Issue:**
- All individual fields configured as `read_only: 1` in DocType JSON
- No conditional logic for field editability based on processing status or field state

**Architecture Limitation:**
- Policy processing runs in main thread via `process_policy()` method
- No use of Frappe's built-in background job system (`frappe.enqueue()`)
- Blocking user interface during processing

### ‚úÖ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

#### Phase 1: Made Fields Conditionally Editable ‚úÖ
1. **Removed `read_only: 1`** from all individual fields in DocType JSON configuration
2. **Added JavaScript field state management** with visual indicators showing:
   - ü§ñ Green robot icon: Field extracted by OCR (unchanged)
   - ‚úèÔ∏è Orange edit icon: Field extracted by OCR but manually modified
   - üë§ Blue user icon: Field manually entered (not extracted)
   - ‚ùì Gray question icon: Field not extracted, needs manual entry

#### Phase 2: Background Processing Implementation ‚úÖ
1. **Refactored `process_policy()` method** to use `frappe.enqueue()` for background processing
2. **Created `process_policy_background()` module-level function** for background job execution
3. **Implemented real-time status updates** via `frappe.publish_realtime()` with event `policy_processing_complete`
4. **Added proper error handling** with timeout management (10 minutes) and comprehensive logging

#### Phase 3: Enhanced User Experience ‚úÖ
1. **Auto-trigger processing** when both PDF file and policy type are set
2. **Added progress indicators**:
   - Fixed position processing indicator with spinner during background processing
   - Real-time notifications on completion/failure with processing time
   - Dashboard status comments during processing
3. **Implemented real-time form updates** via `frappe.realtime.on()` event listeners
4. **Added comprehensive field validation** and data quality tracking

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Python Controller Updates (`policy_document.py`):
- **Background Job Method**: `process_policy()` enqueues background job, returns immediately
- **Internal Processing**: `process_policy_internal()` handles actual OCR processing
- **Real-time Notifications**: `frappe.publish_realtime()` with processing status updates
- **Field Population**: `populate_individual_fields()` maps JSON data to individual fields
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging with `frappe.log_error()` and user notifications

#### JavaScript Enhancements (`policy_document.js`):
- **Real-time Event Listener**: `setup_realtime_listener()` listens for `policy_processing_complete` events
- **Processing Indicators**: `show_processing_indicator()` / `hide_processing_indicator()` for visual feedback
- **Field State Indicators**: `add_field_state_indicators()` shows OCR vs manual data with icons
- **Auto-processing**: Automatic processing trigger when PDF and policy type are set
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Proper error display and user feedback

#### DocType Configuration Updates (`policy_document.json`):
- **Removed `read_only: 1`** from all 28 individual fields (15 Motor + 11 Health + 2 sections)
- **Maintained conditional display** based on policy type
- **Preserved field structure** for reporting and database queries

### Resolution Impact
- ‚úÖ **Manual Field Entry**: Users can now edit any field when OCR extraction fails or is incorrect
- ‚úÖ **Background Processing**: Non-blocking UI with real-time progress updates
- ‚úÖ **Visual Indicators**: Clear distinction between extracted vs manually entered data
- ‚úÖ **Auto-processing**: Seamless workflow from PDF upload to field extraction
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Notifications**: Instant feedback on processing completion/failure
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced UX**: Professional user experience with proper loading states and feedback

### Field State Management
The system now provides clear visual feedback:
- **ü§ñ Green (OCR)**: Field successfully extracted and unchanged
- **‚úèÔ∏è Orange (Modified)**: Field extracted but user made changes  
- **üë§ Blue (Manual)**: Field not extracted, manually entered by user
- **‚ùì Gray (Missing)**: Field not extracted, requires manual entry
